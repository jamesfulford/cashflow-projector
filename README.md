## Implementation Principles

- **Observe immediately**. Fast feedback is key.
- **Truth is enough**. Don't scold or give demeaning suggestions (like "oh no, try cutting costs").
- **Do with, not for**. Users are best suited to make decisions. Don't do it for them.
- **No plan lock-in**. Recognize that life can change suddenly, and don't make that hard on the user.

- **Privacy by default**. Opt-in to sharing data outside of the user's device.
- **Numbers are private**. Do not collect numbers ($ or %).
