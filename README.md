# Solomon

## TODO

- use https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-fs-access to remove localstorage dependency (add step to read from filesystem)
- improve rules listing (sort by financial impact; search)
- improve reconciliation (use a modal; list expected transactions between then and now)
- deploy on github pages

## Ideas

- come up with a good name
- add raw input for RRULE strings and link to here: https://jkbrzt.github.io/rrule/
- add back Hebrew (Hillel) calendar (Python support not working due to micropip)
- add how-to video link in footer
- get a good UX from someone smart
